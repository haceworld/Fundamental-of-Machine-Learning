# Fundamental-of-Machine-Learning
Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning This repository introduces the basics of machine learning algorithms for preprocessing, regression and classification tasks covering the basic theory and common concepts and techniques involved in Machine Learning. This repository is for beginners who are interested in machine learning.  

The ML code is divided into three parts, namely:

1.) Pre-processing model

2.) Regression model and

3.) Classification model
